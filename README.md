# NumberGame
I used basic Python rules in the project.Ä°f you want to understand this project, you must know variable identification, while loop, conditional statements (if-else-elif) and break- continue statements. Also you must look random module.if you don't know these, don't worry. Because, you can learn all of them with short working. I have just started software,too.
